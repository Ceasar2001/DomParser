Sure, here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

The code imports the necessary classes and interfaces from the Java DOM API, as well as the File class from the Java I/O API.

The code defines a Java class named "xmlExtractor".

The code defines a main() method for the class.

Inside the main() method, the code creates a new File object that points to an XML file on disk. The path to the file is hard-coded as a string literal.

The code creates a new DocumentBuilderFactory object, which is used to create a new DocumentBuilder.

The code creates a new DocumentBuilder object using the factory object.

The code parses the XML file using the DocumentBuilder object, resulting in a new Document object.

The code calls the normalize() method on the Document object to ensure that the document is well-formed.

The code prints out the name of the root element of the document.

The code gets a list of all the "student" elements in the document using the getElementsByTagName() method.

The code loops through the list of "student" elements, printing out information about each one.

For each "student" element, the code gets the Node object representing the element and prints out its name.

The code checks whether the Node object is an Element node (as opposed to a Text node or some other type of node).

If the Node object is an Element node, the code casts it to an Element object.

The code then gets the value of the "id", "username", "EnrolledCourse", "mode", and "duration" child elements of the "student" element using the getElementsByTagName() method.

The code prints out the values of each of these elements.

The code catches any exceptions that might be thrown during the parsing process and prints them out.

That's a brief explanation of what this code does. It reads an XML file using a DOM parser and prints out information about each "student" element in the file.
